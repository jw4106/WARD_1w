# Ward_1
Wearable Action Recognition

This application was created using Tizen Studio (C++) as an extension to help record and track motion on smart watches, specifically the new Samsung smart watches. WARD_1w utilizes the Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer sensors. Movements all have different motions which can be recorded based off the three sensors (utilization of the X,Y, and Z axis). This application records data every 38 milliseconds and records the data into a standard text file for data analysis further on.
